I decided to public this repo so that Mike of MikeOfficial.xyz cannot still sell this detected cheat. Features are all made by myself either custom or from Tsunami, with silent aim provided by Ic3 and bypass (now detected) from Suflly. All parts of the cheat are detected, bypass is patched, launcher, cheat, and cleanup exe.

mike, fuck you.

Now that the dust has sufficiently settled and Unturned cheating is dead, this is my second and final Unturned cheat. It was made by myself and Suffly in collaboration with MikeOfficial. Overall it is a much more concise program, at around 7k lines compared to TsunamiHacks 13k. It also took only 4 months to create compared to 7 months for TsunamiHack. It was much more feature rich and more accurately represents the idea that I had when I originally created TsunamiHack.

Many lessons were learned during development, the most notable being to always cover your ass and give yourself a back door. In addition to that security can always be beaten, as shown by my friends and competitors, the developers of the Thanking cheat.

MikePure largely solidified my c# skills and it remains to be to this day the software I am most proud of. Use it as you would like and just remember, fuck mike.
